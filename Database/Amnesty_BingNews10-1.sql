"It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us," she said. "He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him." Zagorski?s death comes after last-minute legal wrangling Zagorski was set to die three weeks ago. His request to die by electric chair saved his life ? at least for a few weeks, when Gov. Bill Haslam granted reprieve three hours before his scheduled execution on Oct. 11. The move bought the state time to prep the chair during last-minute legal wrangling. Zagorski requested death by electric chair with hope that death would come instantaneously ? the ?lesser of two evils? compared to lethal injection, argued federal public defender Kelley Henry. According to a doctor who reviewed Irick?s execution, Irick felt searing pain akin to torture before his death. Experts argue that inmates experience the feeling of ?drowning and burning alive at the same time? that reportedly comes with lethal injection. Questions of if and how Zagorski?s death would play out continued to swirl up over the past month. During his 1984 murder trial, the then-28-year-old Zagorski told his defense team he wanted the death penalty and forbid them to contact his family or dig into his past, according to documents from the Tennessee Supreme Court. But once on death row, Zagorski changed this mind. Thirty-four years and 22 appeals later, he and his new defense team fought for a last-minute court decision to save his life, claiming his trial attorneys made errors in representing him On Oct. 10, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay. The state responded the next morning and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to deny a stay and allow the execution to move forward. Zagorski had asked the federal court to to force the state to use the electric chair for his execution ? the state initially refused and planned to move forward with lethal injection but District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled that afternoon that the state could not use lethal injection until Zagorski''s claim had been heard. Trauger''s ruling likely triggered Haslam?s move for reprieve. An unheard childhood Zagorski grew up poor in Tecumseh, Michigan, about an hour southwest of Detroit, according to an appeal filed to the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1998. His father played little role in his life, and his mother, impaired by a brain injury, had wanted a daughter, according to the appeal. He could not read or write between the ages of 8 and 10. He developed a stutter. He had no eye glasses for a time, despite having poor vision. At an early age, he was exposed to drugs and alcohol. MORE: Edmund Zagorski spent 34 years behind bars with little visitors Zagorski had ?minor skirmishes with the law as a juvenile and federal drug convictions as an adult,? the appeals documents show, but had no convictions for violent crime before the murders of John Dale Dotson and Jimmy Porter in April, 1983. If the jurors had known this, Zagorski and his team argued, it would have kept him from the death penalty. A ''calculated'' murder On April 23, Dotson was making plans with his friend Porter to meet a man he knew as Jesse Lee Hardin to buy 100 pounds of marijuana. Posing as Hardin, Zagorski told Dotson he?d worked as a mercenary in South America and worked a stint drilling for oil near New Orleans. Though not more than acquaintances, the men agreed to meet Zagorski and authorities later found their bodies in a secluded, wooded area near Interstate 65 in Robertson County. When her husband didn?t return home after the meeting, Marsha Dotson said she knew immediately something had happened. Although search efforts began right away, the bodies of Porter and Dotson weren''t found for about two weeks. There was a national manhunt for Zagorski. He was eventually spotted in Ohio and was apprehended after a shootout with police. The inmate?s statements about his time in South America could never be verified, according to Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley, who was an assistant district attorney in 1984 who tried the case and sought the death penalty. ?Whether he was or not, who knows,? the prosecutor said. ?He was apparently a very convincing person to make friends and get these people to believe enough to go out into the woods with him.? SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: The most thorough coverage starting from the moment news breaks A fight for a ''rehabilitated man'' In the 1984 trial, life without parole not an option. It''s a point Zargorski''s attorney Robert Hutton pushed in the petition to commute his sentence. The jury did not have the option to sentence him to life without parole because their only options in the 1984 trial were death or the life with the possibility of parole. Six of the surviving jurors in the case agreed life without parole was an appropriate sentence for Zagorski, the clemency request stated. Today, a death sentence would not be given if just one juror wanted life without parole And while Marsha Dotson for more than 30 years wanted nothing more than to see Zagorski put to death for his crimes, she has since "softened." ?I?ve come to realize that it?s not my place to condemn somebody, to let them die. I can?t play God," Dotson said. Hutton also argued Zaroski has also shown "exemplary" behavior during his prison term as a "rehabilitated man." He never received a single disciplinary infraction and testimonies from officers and volunteers detail his trustworthy, hardworking, respectful and peacekeeping demeanor. "His extraordinary rehabilitation demonstrates that if you commute Ed''s sentence, he will continue to make the prison community a safer place for both officers and inmates," Hutton wrote in the petition. The Roman Catholic bishops of the Nashville and Knoxville dioceses have also spoken out ahead of Zagorski''s execution. What''s next for executions in Tennessee? The debate of capital punishment has burned hot in Tennessee. Like many states, Tennessee?s death penalty law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972. ?READ MORE: Knoxville attorney played role in Georgia''s elimination of electric chair Officials moved quickly to pass new laws governing the punishment in 1975. But legal challenges kept the death penalty on hold, and it wasn?t until 2000 that an execution was carried out. Six men were put to death by lethal injection and one was executed by electric chair through 2009. A hiatus followed until Irick''s execution on Aug. 9. Irick and Zagorski were part of a group of 32 death row offenders suing the state over its lethal injection method. The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 majority in October the drugs can continue in Tennessee even though medical experts said the state''s controversial three-drug protocol tortures inmates to death. The state in the past has also gone back and forth on whether the electric chair should be used again. It''s unclear how Zagorski''s request for the chair will impact executions in the state moving forward but expert on executions predicts more death row inmates could follow his lead.

She was later killed in India, allegedly on the orders of relatives embarrassed by the marriage. Submitted photo. 			 
		
		<p>The alleged honour killers of Jassi Sidhu face yet another appeal in a B.C. court today to determine whether they should be extradited to India to stand trial for her murder.</p>
<p>The accused are B.C. residents: the murdered woman’s uncle, Surgit Singh Badesha; and her mother, Malkit Kaur Sidhu.</p>
<p>It’s alleged the two, while living in Canada, conspired to have hitmen conduct a long-distance honour killing of their niece and daughter in India, because she had defied their wishes and married someone they considered to be from an inferior class.</p>
<p>The appeal hearing, scheduled over the next three days in Vancouver, comes 18 years after Jassi Sidhu’s death, and well over a year since the Supreme Court of Canada, in a unanimous decision, restored the surrender order made by Canada in response to India’s request the two be extradited to Punjab to face justice.</p>
<p>It’s often said the top court is the last court of appeal, but not in this case.</p>
<p>Days before the Supreme Court decision on Sept. 8, 2017, Badesha’s and Sidhu’s lawyers submitted what they said was fresh evidence to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. It’s not known what that evidence was, but the pair’s lawyers have made the argument in previous court cases that the two accused killers might be abused or tortured in an Indian prison, if they are convicted.</p>
<p>Badesha’s lawyer, Michael Klein, said in an interview that Wilson-Raybould’s department and the RCMP were hustling the two out of the country on Sept. 17, 2017. He said that was before the minister issued a decision about what he calls his supplementary submission of fresh evidence.</p>
<p>?They were actually at the airport in Toronto on the way to India. It was only at the last minute (that) the acceptance of our submission at the Court of Appeal prevented that from occurring,? he said.</p>

 	', 5157, N'Jaswinder Kaur Didhu, known as Jassi Sidhu, is seen here in a photo with her husband, Sukwinder Singh Sidhu, known in court documents as Mithu. She was later killed in India, allegedly on the orders of relatives embarrassed by the marriage. Submitted photo. The alleged honour killers of Jassi Sidhu face yet another appeal in a B.C. court today to determine whether they should be extradited to India to stand trial for her murder. The accused are B.C. residents: the murdered woman’s uncle, Surgit Singh Badesha; and her mother, Malkit Kaur Sidhu. It’s alleged the two, while living in Canada, conspired to have hitmen conduct a long-distance honour killing of their niece and daughter in India, because she had defied their wishes and married someone they considered to be from an inferior class. The appeal hearing, scheduled over the next three days in Vancouver, comes 18 years after Jassi Sidhu’s death, and well over a year since the Supreme Court of Canada, in a unanimous decision, restored the surrender order made by Canada in response to India’s request the two be extradited to Punjab to face justice. It’s often said the top court is the last court of appeal, but not in this case. Days before the Supreme Court decision on Sept. 8, 2017, Badesha’s and Sidhu’s lawyers submitted what they said was fresh evidence to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. It’s not known what that evidence was, but the pair’s lawyers have made the argument in previous court cases that the two accused killers might be abused or tortured in an Indian prison, if they are convicted. Badesha’s lawyer, Michael Klein, said in an interview that Wilson-Raybould’s department and the RCMP were hustling the two out of the country on Sept. 17, 2017. He said that was before the minister issued a decision about what he calls his supplementary submission of fresh evidence. ?They were actually at the airport in Toronto on the way to India. It was only at the last minute (that) the acceptance of our submission at the Court of Appeal prevented that from occurring,? he said. It wasn’t the first time a justice minister has tried to execute India’s extradition request. In 2014, then-justice minister Peter MacKay, after receiving assurances from India there would be no death penalty, and that consular staff could visit the two in prison, agreed to a surrender order for Badesha and Sidhu.

Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it." James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 10, 1995. Woolsey told the committee that he could not assure the American people that the CIA could avoid another spy scandal like the Aldrich Ames case. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Why would Georgia?s government go out of the way to frame someone and cover up the incident? Do you have a sense of who was behind that and why? At the time of the murder, Georgia was governed by a four-person council. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze was the most junior member of that council. The real power was held by Jaba Ioseliani, a mafia godfather and the head of 5,000 man army called Mkhedrioni, or the?Horsemen. Ioseliani and his army were known to have close ties to Russian military intelligence and to two of the three people in the car with Woodruff. If there had been a real investigation into the murder then it would have exposed GRU involvement ? and that would not have been in Ioseliani?s best interest. Before he or Russia allowed anything like that to happen, they would have pushed Shevardnadze out of government and America out of Georgia. When you?re talking about the government of Georgia in 1993 and 1994, you aren?t talking about a unified entity. You are looking at an entity dominated by different interest groups. However, those interest groups were in general agreement about the murder of Freddie Woodruff. They all wanted to make this problem go away and at the same time to satisfy the US ? because even if you?re Mkhendrioni you still wanted American money to keep coming into the country.? But as it turned out, satisfying America wasn?t all that hard. Shevardnadze told me that when he met [CIA Director] Woolsey at the airport to deliver Woodruff?s body, the American never mentioned the murder. And on the basis of this startling omission, Shevardnadze concluded that the US just wanted the whole thing to go away.? So that?s exactly what he did. Now that the book has been published, what do you hope will come out of it? I think that Freddie?and Anzor and the Woodruff family have all been publicly dishonored. I am hopeful that the book will end that dishonor. I think Freddy was a hero but has never been accorded the honor of that status. I would like to believe the agency will study this case and work to mitigate risks for future agents caught in a similar situation. But my greatest ambition for this is to persuade people that they can make a difference. That irrespective of the issue, if you care about something enough you can have an impact. You are not limited to the largely sad act of liking something or re-tweeting something. I?m here to tell you that you can step onto the stage and have an effect. In this handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police, Salisbury Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05 p.m. local time on March 4 and released on September 5 in London. Two Russian nationals using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Metropolitan Police via Getty Images Do you think the case of Freddie Woodruff is similar to contemporary cases like the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the U.K. or the death of Alexander Litvinenko? Does this fit a pattern of Russia targeting spies abroad?? There are similarities between the murder of Freddie Woodruff and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko. In all three cases, Russia did not make any significant effort to hide their role in the crimes. The fact of their ruthlessness appeared to be one of the main things they were trying to communicate. In all three cases, Russia violated the sovereignty of an ostensibly friendly nation in order to kill people. This suggests that Russia believes that it has some supranational right to exercise its will against third parties any place on the planet. And in all three cases, a short-term intelligence objective took precedence over a long-term national interest. In the end, Russia appears to have lost more than it gained. The commonalities among these crimes make it clear that our need for institutions like the CIA and NATO is not because Russia was communist, but because Russia is Russia.?', 13327, N' But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he ...', N'The Murder of a CIA Agent In an Unruly Post-Soviet Country Prompted A Texas Attorney To Seek Answers', N'https://www.newsweek.com/pullara-interview-spy-left-behind-georgia-soviet-union-cia-1185955', N'www.newsweek.com', N'US', N'https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/02/spywhowasleftbehind_0.jpg', 3500, 3500)

		<p>A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.</p>
<p>Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.”</p>
<p>An Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post.</p>

(Credit: PA Department of Transportation/CNN)</p>
<p>Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.</p>

(Credit: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love. “I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead. Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.” “I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.” An Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post. This is the Pennsylvania Driver’s License photo of Pittsburgh synagogue suspect Robert Bowers, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. (Credit: PA Department of Transportation/CNN) Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail. Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.” He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.” Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love. “Love.

<p>Two minutes before it was set to begin at 7 p.m., the U.S. Supreme Court denied Zagorski''s appeal on the grounds of the unconstitutionality of choosing between the electric chair and lethal injection. </p><p>As dark clouds loomed over Riverbend Maximum Security Institution and the sunset changed the sky from bright pink to black, a police-escorted van arrived.</p><p>Eight people believed to be family members of the victims entered the prison to witness the execution. </p><p>They waited in front of a covered large window that looked into the execution chamber where on the other side of the glass Zagorski sat pinned in the electric chair, held down by buckles and straps with electrodes fastened to his feet.</p><p>The blinds opened for the rest of the witnesses to see Zagorski dressed in his cotton clothes, smiling and grimacing to the group. </p>      
    
<p>Zagorski  pronounced his last words: "Let?s Rock."</p><p>He sat in the wired chair as prison staff placed a wet sponge that had been soaked in saline solution, and metal helmet on his freshly shaved head. He continued smiling, but would grimace each time drops ran down his face. </p><p>Zagorski raised his eyebrows, appearing to be communicating to his attorney. She sat while nodding and tapping her heart, looking at Zagorski.</p><p>?I told him, when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart,? Zagorski?s attorney Kelley Henry told The Tennessean. She said Zagorski smiled, to encourage her to smile back. </p><p>Then his face was covered with a black shroud so the witnesses couldn''t see his face as electricity jolted through his body.</p><p>The warden gave the signal to proceed. Zagorski lifted his right hand several times in what looked like attempts of a wave, before he clenched his hands into a fist as the first charge of 1,750 volts of electricity through his body for 20 seconds.</p><p>Henry said both pinkies appear to either be dislocated or broken due to the force as he pulled against the straps. She also said there were signs that Zagorski was breathing during a short pause before the second jolt was administered for 15 seconds.</p><p>The doctor overseeing the death appeared in view to check on Zagorski.</p><p>Zagorski was dead. The blinds into the chamber closed.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the victims'' families exited the building and drove away in the van without speaking publicly. </p><p>"First of all I want to make it very clear I have no hard feelings. I don?t want any of you to have this on your conscience, you are all doing your job, and I?m good," Zagorski said before he was taken from his cell to the execution chamber, according to Henry. </p><p>"It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us," she said. "He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him."</p><p>Zagorski?s death comes after last-minute legal wrangling</p><p>Zagorski was set to die three weeks ago.</p><p>His request to die by electric chair saved his life ? at least for a few weeks, when Gov. Bill Haslam granted reprieve three hours before his scheduled execution on Oct. 11.</p>      
    
<p>The move bought the state time to prep the chair during last-minute legal wrangling. </p><p>Zagorski requested death by electric chair with hope that death would come instantaneously ? the ?lesser of two evils? compared to lethal injection, argued federal public defender Kelley Henry. </p><p>According to a doctor who reviewed Irick?s execution, Irick felt searing pain akin to torture before his death . Experts argue that inmates experience the feeling of ?drowning and burning alive at the same time? that reportedly comes with lethal injection.</p><p>Questions of if and how Zagorski?s death would play out continued to swirl up over the past month. </p><p>During his 1984 murder trial, the then-28-year-old Zagorski told his defense team he wanted the death penalty and forbid them to contact his family or dig into his past, according to documents from the Tennessee Supreme Court.</p><p>But once on death row, Zagorski changed this mind. Thirty-four years and 22 appeals later, he and his new defense team fought for a last-minute court decision to save his life, claiming his trial attorneys made errors in representing him</p><p>On Oct. 10, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay. The state responded the next morning and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to deny a stay and allow the execution to move forward.</p><p>Zagorski had asked the federal court to to force the state to use the electric chair for his execution ? the state initially refused and planned to move forward with lethal injection but District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled that afternoon that the state could not use lethal injection until Zagorski''s claim had been heard.</p><p>Trauger''s ruling likely triggered Haslam?s move for reprieve.</p>An unheard childhood<p>Zagorski grew up poor  in Tecumseh, Michigan, about an hour southwest of Detroit, according to an appeal filed to the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1998.</p><p>His father played little role in his life, and his mother, impaired by a brain injury, had wanted a daughter, according to the appeal.</p><p>He could not read or write between the ages of 8 and 10.

If you''re viewing on the ABC10 App, tap here for multimedia. Death row inmate Edmund Zagorski died 7:26 p.m. CDT Thursday after Tennessee prison officials electrocuted him with the electric chair. He was 63. He is the 134th person put to death by Tennessee since 1916 and the second person this year after Billy Ray Irick?s execution by lethal injection on Aug. 9. He is the first person to die by electric chair since Daryl Horton''s execution in 2007. Lt. Governor Randy McNally made the following statement on the execution: "The ultimate penalty is reserved for the most heinous of crimes. This individual shot John Dale Dotson and Jimmy Porter and slit their throats in commission of a robbery. This individual then attempted to kill police officers to avoid being brought to justice. While there is little pleasure in it, there is no doubt justice was served tonight. I can only hope the families of the victims can now have peace." Zagorski was convicted in the April 1983 murders of John Dale Dotson, of Hickman County, and Jimmy Porter, of Dickson. Prosecutors argued Zagorski lured them into the woods in Robertson County with the promise to sell them marijuana, and then he shot them, slit their throats and stole their money.

Two minutes before it was set to begin at 7 p.m., the U.S. Supreme Court denied Zagorski''s appeal on the grounds of the unconstitutionality of choosing between the electric chair and lethal injection. As dark clouds loomed over Riverbend Maximum Security Institution and the sunset changed the sky from bright pink to black, a police-escorted van arrived. Eight people believed to be family members of the victims entered the prison to witness the execution. They waited in front of a covered large window that looked into the execution chamber where on the other side of the glass Zagorski sat pinned in the electric chair, held down by buckles and straps with electrodes fastened to his feet. The blinds opened for the rest of the witnesses to see Zagorski dressed in his cotton clothes, smiling and grimacing to the group. Zagorski pronounced his last words: "Let?s Rock." He sat in the wired chair as prison staff placed a wet sponge that had been soaked in saline solution, and metal helmet on his freshly shaved head. He continued smiling, but would grimace each time drops ran down his face. Zagorski raised his eyebrows, appearing to be communicating to his attorney. She sat while nodding and tapping her heart, looking at Zagorski. ?I told him, when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart,? Zagorski?s attorney Kelley Henry told The Tennessean. She said Zagorski smiled, to encourage her to smile back. Then his face was covered with a black shroud so the witnesses couldn''t see his face as electricity jolted through his body. The warden gave the signal to proceed. Zagorski lifted his right hand several times in what looked like attempts of a wave, before he clenched his hands into a fist as the first charge of 1,750 volts of electricity through his body for 20 seconds. Henry said both pinkies appear to either be dislocated or broken due to the force as he pulled against the straps. She also said there were signs that Zagorski was breathing during a short pause before the second jolt was administered for 15 seconds. The doctor overseeing the death appeared in view to check on Zagorski. Zagorski was dead. The blinds into the chamber closed. Ten minutes later, the victims'' families exited the building and drove away in the van without speaking publicly. "First of all I want to make it very clear I have no hard feelings. I don?t want any of you to have this on your conscience, you are all doing your job, and I?m good," Zagorski said before he was taken from his cell to the execution chamber, according to Henry. "It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us," she said. "He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him." Zagorski?s death comes after last-minute legal wrangling Zagorski was set to die three weeks ago. His request to die by electric chair saved his life ? at least for a few weeks, when Gov. Bill Haslam granted reprieve three hours before his scheduled execution on Oct. 11. The move bought the state time to prep the chair during last-minute legal wrangling. Zagorski requested death by electric chair with hope that death would come instantaneously ? the ?lesser of two evils? compared to lethal injection, argued federal public defender Kelley Henry. According to a doctor who reviewed Irick?s execution, Irick felt searing pain akin to torture before his death. Experts argue that inmates experience the feeling of ?drowning and burning alive at the same time? that reportedly comes with lethal injection. Questions of if and how Zagorski?s death would play out continued to swirl up over the past month. During his 1984 murder trial, the then-28-year-old Zagorski told his defense team he wanted the death penalty and forbid them to contact his family or dig into his past, according to documents from the Tennessee Supreme Court. But once on death row, Zagorski changed this mind. Thirty-four years and 22 appeals later, he and his new defense team fought for a last-minute court decision to save his life, claiming his trial attorneys made errors in representing him On Oct. 10, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay. The state responded the next morning and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to deny a stay and allow the execution to move forward. Zagorski had asked the federal court to to force the state to use the electric chair for his execution ? the state initially refused and planned to move forward with lethal injection but District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled that afternoon that the state could not use lethal injection until Zagorski''s claim had been heard. Trauger''s ruling likely triggered Haslam?s move for reprieve. An unheard childhood Zagorski grew up poor in Tecumseh, Michigan, about an hour southwest of Detroit, according to an appeal filed to the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1998. His father played little role in his life, and his mother, impaired by a brain injury, had wanted a daughter, according to the appeal. He could not read or write between the ages of 8 and 10. He developed a stutter. He had no eye glasses for a time, despite having poor vision. At an early age, he was exposed to drugs and alcohol. MORE: Edmund Zagorski spent 34 years behind bars with little visitors Zagorski had ?minor skirmishes with the law as a juvenile and federal drug convictions as an adult,? the appeals documents show, but had no convictions for violent crime before the murders of John Dale Dotson and Jimmy Porter in April, 1983. If the jurors had known this, Zagorski and his team argued, it would have kept him from the death penalty. A ''calculated'' murder On April 23, Dotson was making plans with his friend Porter to meet a man he knew as Jesse Lee Hardin to buy 100 pounds of marijuana. Posing as Hardin, Zagorski told Dotson he?d worked as a mercenary in South America and worked a stint drilling for oil near New Orleans. Though not more than acquaintances, the men agreed to meet Zagorski and authorities later found their bodies in a secluded, wooded area near Interstate 65 in Robertson County. When her husband didn?t return home after the meeting, Marsha Dotson said she knew immediately something had happened. Although search efforts began right away, the bodies of Porter and Dotson weren''t found for about two weeks. There was a national manhunt for Zagorski. He was eventually spotted in Ohio and was apprehended after a shootout with police. The inmate?s statements about his time in South America could never be verified, according to Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley, who was an assistant district attorney in 1984 who tried the case and sought the death penalty. ?Whether he was or not, who knows,? the prosecutor said. ?He was apparently a very convincing person to make friends and get these people to believe enough to go out into the woods with him.? SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: The most thorough coverage starting from the moment news breaks A fight for a ''rehabilitated man'' In the 1984 trial, life without parole not an option. It''s a point Zargorski''s attorney Robert Hutton pushed in the petition to commute his sentence. The jury did not have the option to sentence him to life without parole because their only options in the 1984 trial were death or the life with the possibility of parole. Six of the surviving jurors in the case agreed life without parole was an appropriate sentence for Zagorski, the clemency request stated. Today, a death sentence would not be given if just one juror wanted life without parole And while Marsha Dotson for more than 30 years wanted nothing more than to see Zagorski put to death for his crimes, she has since "softened." ?I?ve come to realize that it?s not my place to condemn somebody, to let them die. I can?t play God," Dotson said. Hutton also argued Zaroski has also shown "exemplary" behavior during his prison term as a "rehabilitated man." He never received a single disciplinary infraction and testimonies from officers and volunteers detail his trustworthy, hardworking, respectful and peacekeeping demeanor. "His extraordinary rehabilitation demonstrates that if you commute Ed''s sentence, he will continue to make the prison community a safer place for both officers and inmates," Hutton wrote in the petition. The Roman Catholic bishops of the Nashville and Knoxville dioceses have also spoken out ahead of Zagorski''s execution. What''s next for executions in Tennessee? The debate of capital punishment has burned hot in Tennessee. Like many states, Tennessee?s death penalty law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972. ?READ MORE: Knoxville attorney played role in Georgia''s elimination of electric chair Officials moved quickly to pass new laws governing the punishment in 1975. But legal challenges kept the death penalty on hold, and it wasn?t until 2000 that an execution was carried out. Six men were put to death by lethal injection and one was executed by electric chair through 2009. A hiatus followed until Irick''s execution on Aug. 9. Irick and Zagorski were part of a group of 32 death row offenders suing the state over its lethal injection method. The Tennessee Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 majority in October the drugs can continue in Tennessee even though medical experts said the state''s controversial three-drug protocol tortures inmates to death. The state in the past has also gone back and forth on whether the electric chair should be used again. It''s unclear how Zagorski''s request for the chair will impact executions in the state moving forward but expert on executions predicts more death row inmates could follow his lead. Death row inmate David Earl Miller is set to be executed in early December. Miller, 61, was convicted of killing a disabled woman in South Knoxville with a fire poker in 1981. He is the longest current member of Tennessee''s death row.

Federal prosecutors were quick to charge the accused gunman, Robert Bowers, with hate crimes for each fatality. Listen Listening... / 4:50 90.5 WESA''s An-Li Herring explores moral and religious questions regarding the possibility that the accused gunman in the Tree of Life shooting will be sentenced to death. ?And each of these counts is punishable by death,? U.S. Attorney Scott Brady noted at a news conference a day after the shooting. ?Know that we will spare no effort or resource in ensuring that the defendant is held fully accountable for his unspeakable and hateful crimes.? But while the choice to apply the death penalty may be straightforward for prosecutors, in cases like this, capital punishment raises both moral and religious questions. For example, although Bowers could face execution for targeting Jews, the faith itself urges the penalty be applied only in the rarest cases. Jewish law says two eyewitnesses must show the accused killer acted intentionally by proving the accused received and acknowledged their warnings that the crime would be punishable by death. ?In order for capital punishment to take place, the level of proof would be so high that it would almost never take place,? explained Rabbi Elie Spitz. Spitzs leads Congregation B?nai Israel in Tustin, Calif., and has written about capital punishment. He said that, even though Jewish scripture allows the death penalty, early rabbis worried it could be abused by the powerful. In addition, he noted that the Jewish state of Israel has carried out only one execution ? that of Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann. Still, Spitz said execution would be appropriate for the Tree of Life attack. ?Hate crimes of all kinds, whether on race, religion, gender identity, requires a community to state in the strongest terms, ?This is not who we are. This will have no place,?? he said. But at a rally to honor the victims of the shooting last week, Pittsburgh native Ruth Berry said the government shouldn?t use death as punishment. ?I believe that that belongs to something a little higher than all of us.

With this framework, Ledewitz said, juries in the U.S. apply capital punishment in a ?completely arbitrary? fashion. He thinks, in a more objective system, every murderer would be executed, or none of them would be. As it stands, though, juries weighing the death penalty must consider what motivated the accused ? a process Ledewitz said could be painful. ?People who call for the death penalty do not understand how hurtful to survivors it is to have to sit through a sentencing hearing in which we have to seem to care about why the defendant did what he did, when really nothing would justify it,? Ledewitz said. University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel added there?s little to justify the death penalty itself. ?The state should not be in the business of killing people,? he said. ?And they should only be in the business of killing people if it?s in self-defense, if there is an imminent danger to the population.? A constitutional and human rights attorney, Lobel said the alleged shooter at Tree of Life does not pose such a danger, now that he is in federal custody and likely to die there if convicted. Even though Lobel was friends with some of the worshippers who were killed at the synagogue, he said society must be humane in punishing the alleged gunman. As an analogy, Lobel said, he would also ?oppose punishing somebody by rape if they raped somebody or punishing somebody by torture if they tortured somebody.?

		<p>A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.</p>
<p>Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.”</p>
<p>An Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post.</p>

(Credit: PA Department of Transportation/CNN)</p>
<p>Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.</p>
<p>Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.”</p>

<p>He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.”</p>

(Credit: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love. “I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead. Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.” “I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.” An Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post. This is the Pennsylvania Driver’s License photo of Pittsburgh synagogue suspect Robert Bowers, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. (Credit: PA Department of Transportation/CNN) Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail. Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.” He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.” Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love. “Love. That’s why I did it,” he said. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity.

I made my first FOIA request in 1994 and I made my first trip to Georgia in 2004. I got Anzor out of prison in 2008. And I was still making trips and trying to reverse the conviction until 2013. I would say, in terms of actively pursuing the case, 2004 to 2009 was the most active period.</p><p>It never occurred to me to write a book until at one point in the process the State Department accused me of doing the whole project as a publicity stunt in order to write a book. I guess I have them to thank.</p><p>After Anzor was released from prison he called me and asked me for money. One of my solutions for getting him money was buying his?rights to the book. I paid him upfront. I bought the rights up front in cash, and I will give him some of the proceeds from the book.

Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images   </p><p>If Aldrich Ames was to blame for the murder, why do you think the CIA would want to cover that up? Would it not be easier to pin the murder on a traitor, someone who had spied for the Soviet Union?</p><p>I have my suspicions and conclusions about that. First, I have nothing but enormous respect for the professionals at the [CIA] agency and the [FBI] bureau. The closer I got to their work the more astounded I was at their excellence and expertise.</p><p>Both the agency the bureau already knew that Ames was a spy at the time that they let him go to Georgia. The decision to let people go to Tbilisi in 1993 was part of the Ames investigation. They had already searched his home and office, had already installed audio and video surveillance, and were already following him 24 hours a day.</p><p>The CIA had already briefed [former national security adviser] Tony Lake and Lake had already briefed [former President] Bill Clinton. The DOJ had already opened a criminal case against Ames for espionage. The investigation of Ames was largely complete.?</p><p>They were allowing [Ames] to continue to be free because they had more losses than could be explained by Aldrich Ames alone, and I believe they made the calculated decision to let him go free and see if he led them to another spy.</p><p>So they let this unwitting CIA officer, Woodruff, be exposed to Ames. It was generally reported that Ames and Woodruff had an angry confrontation in Tbilisi.</p><p>While he was in Tbilisi, Ames and Woodruff spent a ton of time together: a day driving to the Russian border and a night getting drunk. After that night with Ames, Woodruff was morose and visibly distracted. And he was later observed having an angry confrontation with Ames at a Tbilisi bar. No one knows exactly why they argued, but the context suggests that on their night out Ames had gotten drunk and said something that made Woodruff suspicious.</p><p>But if?the agency knows that Ames is a spy and they know there was a confrontation, and?they aren?t protecting Woodruff from what he may have found out, I think there is responsibility there that they are trying to deal with.?</p><p>The agency had trained Woodruff to be suspicious but did not protect him from the possibility that his suspicion might fall on Ames. The agency had intentionally exposed Woodruff to a known traitor without a plan to protect him if he somehow uncovered evidence of Ames?s treachery. I think this was an error in judgment that contributed to Woodruff?s death and to the agency?s decision to cover up the murder.</p><p>If the FBI had been permitted to perform a thorough investigation, the evidence would certainly have led back to Ames and, in short order, to the suspect decision by the bureau and the agency to allow Ames to travel to the former Soviet Union. But by waiting to arrest Ames until after a patsy had been convicted of the murder, the men and women who had made that suspect decision distracted the public and avoided all accountability for their part in Woodruff?s death.</p><p>Ames would have known that he had committed a serious indiscretion by revealing himself to Woodruff. His only recourse was to contact his Russian handlers immediately and obtain either asylum or assistance. This would have been easy to do because Ames wasn?t being followed in Georgia and because there were lots of KGB and GRU agents in Tbilisi.</p><p>But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he left the country. You see, the Russians knew CIA culture and they knew that Woodruff would wait to report his suspicions until he got back to headquarters in Langley, Virginia. This meant the Russians had a two-week window in which to assassinate him.</p><p>When Ames was finally arrested in February 1994?? a week after Anzor Sharmaidze was convicted of killing Woodruff?? the FBI began immediately to investigate whether there was a connection between Ames and the Woodruff murder. However, they were frustrated in pursuing that investigation. The arrest of Ames had created a new imperative?? that the traitor not be accused?of murdering an American. He could kill a bunch of Russians and still go to prison for life. But if he caused the death of a CIA colleague then it would be very hard for him to avoid the death penalty. And the CIA needed Ames alive so they could debrief him over the next 30 years, a process known as "walking the cat backwards." The agency knew that if wanted to protect Ames from the death penalty, then they had to protect him from being accused of Woodruff?s murder.</p><p>So political convenience met political necessity. And Freddie Woodruff got left behind.</p><p>Have people in the CIA confirmed this theory?</p><p>Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it."</p><p>  <img itemprop="contentUrl" width="594" height="418" class="mapping-embed lazysize lazyload" src="https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/11/02/gettyimages-51969631-594x594.jpg" alt="gettyimages-51969631-594x594" title="" />  James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol H', 9997, N'On August 8, 1993,?Freddie Woodruff, the CIA branch chief in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, was shot in the head and killed.

In his new book The Spy Who Was Left Behind, Pullara describes in vivid detail his investigation, which spanned decades and borders, and how he linked Woodruff?s murder to Russia?s Special Forces and to veteran CIA agent Aldrich Ames, who was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union just months after Woodruff was killed.? Pullara succeeded in having Sharmaidze released from prison in 2008. In 2013, Georgia?s justice minister Tea Tsulukiani said she believes the case ?had not been properly investigated." In a conversation with Newsweek, Pullara describes his hopes for the new book and why he believes it took so long for the truth about Woodruff?s death to be discovered. How long did this investigation take? I started in 1993, literally the day after the murder was presented in The New York Times. I made my first FOIA request in 1994 and I made my first trip to Georgia in 2004. I got Anzor out of prison in 2008. And I was still making trips and trying to reverse the conviction until 2013. I would say, in terms of actively pursuing the case, 2004 to 2009 was the most active period. It never occurred to me to write a book until at one point in the process the State Department accused me of doing the whole project as a publicity stunt in order to write a book. I guess I have them to thank. After Anzor was released from prison he called me and asked me for money. One of my solutions for getting him money was buying his?rights to the book. I paid him upfront. I bought the rights up front in cash, and I will give him some of the proceeds from the book. I wanted him to feel like he was getting fair value for selling his experience. Former senior Central Intelligence Agency officer Aldrich Hazen Ames is led from U.S. Federal Courthouse in Alexandria on February 22, 1994, after being arraigned on charges of spying for the former Soviet Union. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images If Aldrich Ames was to blame for the murder, why do you think the CIA would want to cover that up? Would it not be easier to pin the murder on a traitor, someone who had spied for the Soviet Union? I have my suspicions and conclusions about that. First, I have nothing but enormous respect for the professionals at the [CIA] agency and the [FBI] bureau. The closer I got to their work the more astounded I was at their excellence and expertise. Both the agency the bureau already knew that Ames was a spy at the time that they let him go to Georgia. The decision to let people go to Tbilisi in 1993 was part of the Ames investigation. They had already searched his home and office, had already installed audio and video surveillance, and were already following him 24 hours a day. The CIA had already briefed [former national security adviser] Tony Lake and Lake had already briefed [former President] Bill Clinton. The DOJ had already opened a criminal case against Ames for espionage. The investigation of Ames was largely complete.? They were allowing [Ames] to continue to be free because they had more losses than could be explained by Aldrich Ames alone, and I believe they made the calculated decision to let him go free and see if he led them to another spy. So they let this unwitting CIA officer, Woodruff, be exposed to Ames. It was generally reported that Ames and Woodruff had an angry confrontation in Tbilisi. While he was in Tbilisi, Ames and Woodruff spent a ton of time together: a day driving to the Russian border and a night getting drunk. After that night with Ames, Woodruff was morose and visibly distracted. And he was later observed having an angry confrontation with Ames at a Tbilisi bar. No one knows exactly why they argued, but the context suggests that on their night out Ames had gotten drunk and said something that made Woodruff suspicious. But if?the agency knows that Ames is a spy and they know there was a confrontation, and?they aren?t protecting Woodruff from what he may have found out, I think there is responsibility there that they are trying to deal with.? The agency had trained Woodruff to be suspicious but did not protect him from the possibility that his suspicion might fall on Ames. The agency had intentionally exposed Woodruff to a known traitor without a plan to protect him if he somehow uncovered evidence of Ames?s treachery. I think this was an error in judgment that contributed to Woodruff?s death and to the agency?s decision to cover up the murder. If the FBI had been permitted to perform a thorough investigation, the evidence would certainly have led back to Ames and, in short order, to the suspect decision by the bureau and the agency to allow Ames to travel to the former Soviet Union. But by waiting to arrest Ames until after a patsy had been convicted of the murder, the men and women who had made that suspect decision distracted the public and avoided all accountability for their part in Woodruff?s death. Ames would have known that he had committed a serious indiscretion by revealing himself to Woodruff. His only recourse was to contact his Russian handlers immediately and obtain either asylum or assistance. This would have been easy to do because Ames wasn?t being followed in Georgia and because there were lots of KGB and GRU agents in Tbilisi. But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he left the country. You see, the Russians knew CIA culture and they knew that Woodruff would wait to report his suspicions until he got back to headquarters in Langley, Virginia. This meant the Russians had a two-week window in which to assassinate him. When Ames was finally arrested in February 1994?? a week after Anzor Sharmaidze was convicted of killing Woodruff?? the FBI began immediately to investigate whether there was a connection between Ames and the Woodruff murder. However, they were frustrated in pursuing that investigation. The arrest of Ames had created a new imperative?? that the traitor not be accused?of murdering an American. He could kill a bunch of Russians and still go to prison for life. But if he caused the death of a CIA colleague then it would be very hard for him to avoid the death penalty. And the CIA needed Ames alive so they could debrief him over the next 30 years, a process known as "walking the cat backwards." The agency knew that if wanted to protect Ames from the death penalty, then they had to protect him from being accused of Woodruff?s murder. So political convenience met political necessity. And Freddie Woodruff got left behind. Have people in the CIA confirmed this theory? Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it." James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 10, 1995. Woolsey told the committee that he could not assure the American people that the CIA could avoid another spy scandal like the Aldrich Ames case. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Why would Georgia?s government go out of the way to frame someone and cover up the incident? Do you have a sense of who was behind that and why? At the time of the murder, Georgia was governed by a four-person council. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze was the most junior member of that council. The real power was held by Jaba Ioseliani, a mafia godfather and the head of 5,000 man army called Mkhedrioni, or the?Horsemen. Ioseliani and his army were known to have close ties to Russian military intelligence and to two of the three people in the car with Woodruff. If there had been a real investigation into the murder then it would have exposed GRU involvement ? and that would not have been in Ioseliani?s best interest. Before he or Russia allowed anything like that to happen, they would have pushed Shevardnadze out of government and America out of Georgia. When you?re talking about the government of Georgia in 1993 and 1994, you aren?t talking about a unified entity. You are looking at an entity dominated by different interest groups. However, those interest groups were in general agreement about the murder of Freddie Woodruff. They all wanted to make this problem go away and at the same time to satisfy the US ? because even if you?re Mkhendrioni you still wanted American money to keep coming into the country.? But as it turned out, satisfying America wasn?t all that hard. Shevardnadze told me that when he met [CIA Director] Woolsey at the airport to deliver Woodruff?s body, the American never mentioned the murder. And on the basis of this startling omission, Shevardnadze concluded that the US just wanted the whole thing to go away.? So that?s exactly what he did. Now that the book has been published, what do you hope will come out of it? I think that Freddie?and Anzor and the Woodruff family have all been publicly dishonored. I am hopeful that the book will end that dishonor. I think Freddy was a hero but has never been accorded the honor of that status. I would like to believe the agency will study this case and work to mitigate risks for future agents caught in a similar situation. But my greatest ambition for this is to persuade people that they can make a difference. That irrespective of the issue, if you care about something enough you can have an impact. You are not limited to the largely sad act of liking something or re-tweeting something. I?m here to tell you that you can step onto the stage and have an effect. In this handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police, Salisbury Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05 p.m. local time on March 4 and released on September 5 in London. Two Russian nationals using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Metropolitan Police via Getty Images Do you think the case of Freddie Woodruff is similar to contemporary cases like the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the U.K. or the death of Alexander Litvinenko? Does this fit a pattern of Russia targeting spies abroad?? There are similarities between the murder of Freddie Woodruff and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko. In all three cases, Russia did not make any significant effort to hide their role in the crimes. The fact of their ruthlessness appeared to be one of the main things they were trying to communicate. In all three cases, Russia violated the sovereignty of an ostensibly friendly nation in order to kill people. This suggests that Russia believes that it has some supranational right to exercise its will against third parties any place on the planet. And in all three cases, a short-term intelligence objective took precedence over a long-term national interest. In the end, Russia appears to have lost more than it gained. The commonalities among these crimes make it clear that our need for institutions like the CIA and NATO is not because Russia was communist, but because Russia is Russia.?', 13327, N' But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he ...', N'The Murder of a CIA Agent In an Unruly Post-Soviet Country Prompted A Texas Attorney To Seek Answers', N'https://www.newsweek.com/pullara-interview-spy-left-behind-georgia-soviet-union-cia-1185955', N'www.newsweek.com', N'US', N'https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/02/spywhowasleftbehind_0.jpg', 3500, 3500)

		<p>A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.</p>
<p>Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.”</p>

<p>Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.</p>
<p>Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.”</p>

<p>He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.”</p>
<p>Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love.</p>
<p>“Love. That’s why I did it,” he said. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. … I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish instill in you.

<p>The International Crimes Tribunal-1 yesterday found two people, including a former leader of Habiganj Awami League, guilty of crimes committed during the Liberation War in 1971 and sentenced them to death.</p>
<p>The convicts were awarded the punishment for their direct involvement in genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated in three upazilas -- Lakhai of Habiganj, Nasirnagar of Brahmanbaria and Astogram of Kishoreganj.</p>
<p>Liakat Ali, 63, former president of Lakhai upazila AL, and Aminul Islam alias Rajab Ali, 62, of Astogram upazila, are now on the run.</p>
<p>Liakat was a commander of local ?Razakar Bahini? and Aminul a commander of local ?Al-Badr Bahini?. They, however, used to move together in the localities and had a nexus with the Pakistan army stationed in Astogram. Both Razakar and Al-Badr Bahini were auxiliary forces of the Pakistan army in 1971.?</p>
<p>?The accused are found to have had culpable and physical participation in the commission of barbaric crimes which indisputably shock the humanity,? the three-member tribunal said.</p>
<p>Tribunal Chairman Justice Md Shahinur Islam, and members Justice Amir Hossain and Justice Md Abu Ahmed Jamadar read the summary of 312-page judgment in the presence of the victims'' families, the prosecution and the defence.</p>
 CONVICTS'' IDENTITY, ROLE 
<p>A college student in 1971, Liakat, son of Khelu Mia of Lakhai, was involved with the Muslim League, along with his maternal uncle, according to case documents.</p>
<p>During the Liberation War, his uncle became the chairman of Fandauk Union Peace Committee, an anti-liberation force, in Nasirnagar upazila, while he led the union''s ?Razakar Bahini?.</p>
<p>Liakat committed the crimes with the assistance from the Pakistan army and went into hiding after the war. He later got involved in AL politics and was the president of Lakhai upazila AL from 2003 to 2013.</p>
<p>He hid again when investigations against him began in November 2014. He is believed to be in the US, according to investigators.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aminul, son of Abdul Goni Munshi of Astogram, was the president of Islami Chhatra Sangha''s Haji Hasmat Ali College unit in 1970. He formed the ?Al-Badr Bahini? with the activists of Chhatra Sangha, the then student body of Jamaat, in Astogram during the war, read the case documents.?</p>

 ''NO ABSOLUTION FOR CRIMES''?? 
<p>About Liakat''s involvement with the AL after the Liberation War, the tribunal said subsequent act or sham allegiance to a pro-liberation party intending to hide his horrendous deeds does not absolve his liability of crimes he committed in 1971.</p>

  ', 4951, N'They were involved in genocide, crimes against humanity in 1971 The International Crimes Tribunal-1 yesterday found two people, including a former leader of Habiganj Awami League, guilty of crimes committed during the Liberation War in 1971 and sentenced them to death. The convicts were awarded the punishment for their direct involvement in genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated in three upazilas -- Lakhai of Habiganj, Nasirnagar of Brahmanbaria and Astogram of Kishoreganj. Liakat Ali, 63, former president of Lakhai upazila AL, and Aminul Islam alias Rajab Ali, 62, of Astogram upazila, are now on the run. Liakat was a commander of local ?Razakar Bahini? and Aminul a commander of local ?Al-Badr Bahini?. They, however, used to move together in the localities and had a nexus with the Pakistan army stationed in Astogram. Both Razakar and Al-Badr Bahini were auxiliary forces of the Pakistan army in 1971.? ?The accused are found to have had culpable and physical participation in the commission of barbaric crimes which indisputably shock the humanity,? the three-member tribunal said. Tribunal Chairman Justice Md Shahinur Islam, and members Justice Amir Hossain and Justice Md Abu Ahmed Jamadar read the summary of 312-page judgment in the presence of the victims'' families, the prosecution and the defence. CONVICTS'' IDENTITY, ROLE A college student in 1971, Liakat, son of Khelu Mia of Lakhai, was involved with the Muslim League, along with his maternal uncle, according to case documents. During the Liberation War, his uncle became the chairman of Fandauk Union Peace Committee, an anti-liberation force, in Nasirnagar upazila, while he led the union''s ?Razakar Bahini?. Liakat committed the crimes with the assistance from the Pakistan army and went into hiding after the war. He later got involved in AL politics and was the president of Lakhai upazila AL from 2003 to 2013. He hid again when investigations against him began in November 2014. He is believed to be in the US, according to investigators. Meanwhile, Aminul, son of Abdul Goni Munshi of Astogram, was the president of Islami Chhatra Sangha''s Haji Hasmat Ali College unit in 1970. He formed the ?Al-Badr Bahini? with the activists of Chhatra Sangha, the then student body of Jamaat, in Astogram during the war, read the case documents.? He perpetrated the atrocities in collaboration with the Pakistan army. Freedom fighters caught him towards the end of the war. Three cases were filed against him under the Collaborator Act, 1972, and he was given the life sentence but was released in 1981 after the political changeover. ?The self-proclaimed criminal? even wrote a book titled ?Ami Al-Badr Bolchi? after his release.

                    <p>The Tree of Life shooting , which left 11 Jewish worshippers dead, has been deemed the most fatal anti-Semitic attack in American history. Federal prosecutors were quick to charge the accused gunman, Robert Bowers, with hate crimes for each fatality.</p>
<p>?And each of these counts is punishable by death,? U.S. Attorney Scott Brady noted at a news conference a day after the shooting. ?Know that we will spare no effort or resource in ensuring that the defendant is held fully accountable for his unspeakable and hateful crimes.?</p>
<p>But while the choice to apply the death penalty may be straightforward for prosecutors, in cases like this, capital punishment raises both moral and religious questions.</p>
<p>For example, although Bowers could face execution for targeting Jews, the faith itself urges the penalty be applied only in the rarest cases. Jewish law says two eyewitnesses must show the accused killer acted intentionally by proving the accused received and acknowledged their warnings that the crime would be punishable by death.</p>
<p>?In order for capital punishment to take place, the level of proof would be so high that it would almost never take place,? explained Rabbi Elie Spitz. Spitzs leads Congregation B?nai Israel in Tustin, Calif., and has written about capital punishment.</p>
<p>He said that, even though Jewish scripture allows the death penalty, early rabbis worried it could be abused by the powerful. In addition, he noted that the Jewish state of Israel has carried out only one execution ? that of Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann.</p>
<p>Still, Spitz said execution would be appropriate for the Tree of Life attack.</p>
<p>?Hate crimes of all kinds, whether on race, religion, gender identity, requires a community to state in the strongest terms, ?This is not who we are. This will have no place,?? he said.</p>
<p>But at a rally to honor the victims of the shooting last week, Pittsburgh native Ruth Berry said the government shouldn?t use death as punishment.</p>
<p>?I believe that that belongs to something a little higher than all of us. I can?t judge,? she said while standing in a cold rain that saturated the lawn at the Downtown rally.</p>
<p>Execution once was a religious ritual meant to help defendants pay for their sins, or to ?get right with God,? according to Duquesne University law professor Bruce Ledewitz.</p>
<p>Ledewitz has researched Judaism and the death penalty, and has served as a defense attorney in dozens of capital cases in Pennsylvania. He said that in the modern United States, execution has become a secular practice based on the ?abstract morality? that only the most culpable defendants should be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>?The death penalty that we actually have calls upon us to make a moral judgment, which is almost impossible to make ? which is, among all the killers, which killers are the most morally reprehensible??</p>
<p>With this framework, Ledewitz said, juries in the U.S. apply capital punishment in a ?completely arbitrary? fashion. He thinks, in a more objective system, every murderer would be executed, or none of them would be.</p>
<p>As it stands, though, juries weighing the death penalty must consider what motivated the accused ? a process Ledewitz said could be painful.</p>
<p>?People who call for the death penalty do not understand how hurtful to survivors it is to have to sit through a sentencing hearing in which we have to seem to care about why the defendant did what he did, when really nothing would justify it,? Ledewitz said.</p>
<p>University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel added there?s little to justify the death penalty itself.</p>
<p>?The state should not be in the business of killing people,? he said. ?And they should only be in the business of killing people if it?s in self-defense, if there is an imminent danger to the population.?</p>
<p>A constitutional and human rights attorney, Lobel said the alleged shooter at Tree of Life does not pose such a danger, now that he is in federal custody and likely to die there if convicted.</p>
<p>Even though Lobel was friends with some of the worshippers who were killed at the synagogue, he said society must be humane in punishing the alleged gunman.</p>
<p>As an analogy, Lobel said, he would also ?oppose punishing somebody by rape if they raped somebody or punishing somebody by torture if they tortured somebody.?</p>
<p>Rabbi Spitz in California agrees that overusing the death penalty could make society less humane. But he said that crimes like the Tree of Life shooting pose a more immediate threat.</p>
<p>?What?s distinctive about it is the nature of community, the nature of the social fabric, [and] that a mass murder based on hate, or a crime based on hate, is an attack on society itself,? he said.</p>
<p>Ledewitz of Duquesne contends, however, society can better protect itself by expelling such criminals as quickly as possible. If it weren?t for the drawn-out sentencing proceeding and subsequent appeals that often accompany the death penalty, he said, the alleged shooter would be found guilty ? and never be heard from again.</p>

		<p>The alleged honour killers of Jassi Sidhu face yet another appeal in a B.C. court today to determine whether they should be extradited to India to stand trial for her murder.</p>
<p>The accused are B.C. residents: the murdered woman’s uncle, Surgit Singh Badesha; and her mother, Malkit Kaur Sidhu.</p>
<p>It’s alleged the two, while living in Canada, conspired to have hitmen conduct a long-distance honour killing of their niece and daughter in India, because she had defied their wishes and married someone they considered to be from an inferior class.</p>
<p>The appeal hearing, scheduled over the next three days in Vancouver, comes 18 years after Jassi Sidhu’s death, and well over a year since the Supreme Court of Canada, in a unanimous decision, restored the surrender order made by Canada in response to India’s request the two be extradited to Punjab to face justice.</p>
<p>It’s often said the top court is the last court of appeal, but not in this case.</p>
<p>Days before the Supreme Court decision on Sept. 8, 2017, Badesha’s and Sidhu’s lawyers submitted what they said was fresh evidence to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. It’s not known what that evidence was, but the pair’s lawyers have made the argument in previous court cases that the two accused killers might be abused or tortured in an Indian prison, if they are convicted.</p>
<p>Badesha’s lawyer, Michael Klein, said in an interview that Wilson-Raybould’s department and the RCMP were hustling the two out of the country on Sept. 17, 2017. He said that was before the minister issued a decision about what he calls his supplementary submission of fresh evidence.</p>
<p>?They were actually at the airport in Toronto on the way to India. It was only at the last minute (that) the acceptance of our submission at the Court of Appeal prevented that from occurring,? he said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time a justice minister has tried to execute India’s extradition request.</p>
<p>In 2014, then-justice minister Peter MacKay, after receiving assurances from India there would be no death penalty, and that consular staff could visit the two in prison, agreed to a surrender order for Badesha and Sidhu.</p>
<p>This was after B.C. Judge Gregory Fitch ruled that ?a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the respondents, enraged by the victim?s defiance of their authority, hired the Indian perpetrators to commit the murder.?</p>
<p>However, the B.C. Court of Appeal overturned the surrender order because Basheda’s and Sidhu’s health and safety might be endangered in an Indian jail.</p>
<p>Klein says he is pursuing two issues at the B.C. Court of Appeal on Monday. ?The fundamental question,? he said, ?is whether or not the minister’s actions (by attempting to whisk the two out of a country at the same time new evidence was submitted) amount to an abuse of process, such that a stay of proceedings has to be granted by a court as remedy.?</p>
<p>He says the second issue relates to Wilson-Raybould’s decision on Sept. 28, 2017, about the submitted new evidence, which she found wasn’t significant enough to thwart the extradition process. He wants her decision reviewed by the B.C. Appeal Court.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, it’s another delay in the pursuit of justice for Jassi Sidhu, and part of the tragic story of a Canadian citizen murdered in another country because of what may have been beliefs about a woman’s role in a patriarchal system.</p>
<p>Jassi Sidhu was born in Canada and grew up on a large family estate in Maple Ridge, B.C., a community about 40 kilometres from Vancouver. The head of the household was her uncle Badesha, who had left India in the 1970s and had become a wealthy blueberry farmer.</p>
<p>By the time his niece was in her early 20s and working at a local beauty salon, her uncle had arranged a marriage for her to one of his business associates, a much older man.</p>
<p>But she had already secretly married a man her own age whom she had met in India: Sukhwinder Singh Sidhu (known in court documents as ?Mithu?).</p>
<p>Her family was furious, and when she returned alone to Canada, she had to have the RCMP escort her from the family compound in Maple Ridge so she could join her husband in Punjab.</p>
<p>She told the RCMP and Punjabi police she feared for her life. ?</p>
<p>In India on June 8, 2000, she and Mithu were ambushed by a gang of men brandishing hockey sticks and a sword. Mithu was badly cut and Jassi was abducted and pushed into a car. She was found the next day on the road with her throat slit. She was 24 years old.</p>
<p>In March 2017, Badesha, who’s been in custody in B.C. since 2014, applied for bail. He was turned down.</p>

However, they were frustrated in pursuing that investigation. The arrest of Ames had created a new imperative?? that the traitor not be accused?of murdering an American. He could kill a bunch of Russians and still go to prison for life. But if he caused the death of a CIA colleague then it would be very hard for him to avoid the death penalty. And the CIA needed Ames alive so they could debrief him over the next 30 years, a process known as "walking the cat backwards."

When Ames was finally arrested in February 1994?? a week after Anzor Sharmaidze was convicted of killing Woodruff?? the FBI began immediately to investigate whether there was a connection between Ames and the Woodruff murder. However, they were frustrated in pursuing that investigation. The arrest of Ames had created a new imperative?? that the traitor not be accused?of murdering an American. He could kill a bunch of Russians and still go to prison for life. But if he caused the death of a CIA colleague then it would be very hard for him to avoid the death penalty. And the CIA needed Ames alive so they could debrief him over the next 30 years, a process known as "walking the cat backwards." The agency knew that if wanted to protect Ames from the death penalty, then they had to protect him from being accused of Woodruff?s murder. So political convenience met political necessity. And Freddie Woodruff got left behind. Have people in the CIA confirmed this theory? Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it." James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 10, 1995. Woolsey told the committee that he could not assure the American people that the CIA could avoid another spy scandal like the Aldrich Ames case. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Why would Georgia?s government go out of the way to frame someone and cover up the incident? Do you have a sense of who was behind that and why? At the time of the murder, Georgia was governed by a four-person council. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze was the most junior member of that council. The real power was held by Jaba Ioseliani, a mafia godfather and the head of 5,000 man army called Mkhedrioni, or the?Horsemen. Ioseliani and his army were known to have close ties to Russian military intelligence and to two of the three people in the car with Woodruff. If there had been a real investigation into the murder then it would have exposed GRU involvement ? and that would not have been in Ioseliani?s best interest. Before he or Russia allowed anything like that to happen, they would have pushed Shevardnadze out of government and America out of Georgia. When you?re talking about the government of Georgia in 1993 and 1994, you aren?t talking about a unified entity. You are looking at an entity dominated by different interest groups. However, those interest groups were in general agreement about the murder of Freddie Woodruff. They all wanted to make this problem go away and at the same time to satisfy the US ? because even if you?re Mkhendrioni you still wanted American money to keep coming into the country.? But as it turned out, satisfying America wasn?t all that hard. Shevardnadze told me that when he met [CIA Director] Woolsey at the airport to deliver Woodruff?s body, the American never mentioned the murder. And on the basis of this startling omission, Shevardnadze concluded that the US just wanted the whole thing to go away.? So that?s exactly what he did. Now that the book has been published, what do you hope will come out of it? I think that Freddie?and Anzor and the Woodruff family have all been publicly dishonored. I am hopeful that the book will end that dishonor. I think Freddy was a hero but has never been accorded the honor of that status. I would like to believe the agency will study this case and work to mitigate risks for future agents caught in a similar situation. But my greatest ambition for this is to persuade people that they can make a difference. That irrespective of the issue, if you care about something enough you can have an impact. You are not limited to the largely sad act of liking something or re-tweeting something. I?m here to tell you that you can step onto the stage and have an effect. In this handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police, Salisbury Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05 p.m. local time on March 4 and released on September 5 in London. Two Russian nationals using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Metropolitan Police via Getty Images Do you think the case of Freddie Woodruff is similar to contemporary cases like the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the U.K. or the death of Alexander Litvinenko? Does this fit a pattern of Russia targeting spies abroad?? There are similarities between the murder of Freddie Woodruff and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko. In all three cases, Russia did not make any significant effort to hide their role in the crimes. The fact of their ruthlessness appeared to be one of the main things they were trying to communicate. In all three cases, Russia violated the sovereignty of an ostensibly friendly nation in order to kill people. This suggests that Russia believes that it has some supranational right to exercise its will against third parties any place on the planet. And in all three cases, a short-term intelligence objective took precedence over a long-term national interest. In the end, Russia appears to have lost more than it gained. The commonalities among these crimes make it clear that our need for institutions like the CIA and NATO is not because Russia was communist, but because Russia is Russia.?', 13327, N' But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he ...', N'The Murder of a CIA Agent In an Unruly Post-Soviet Country Prompted A Texas Attorney To Seek Answers', N'https://www.newsweek.com/pullara-interview-spy-left-behind-georgia-soviet-union-cia-1185955', N'www.newsweek.com', N'US', N'https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/02/spywhowasleftbehind_0.jpg', 3500, 3500)

Police say they want those suspects behind bars as quickly as possible, because they have threatened witnesses in the case. Suspects in court for East Cleveland torture death case Standing before an East Cleveland Judge, 23-year-old murder suspect Ronald Newberry did not show any emotion. ?Detectives bond recommendations is $5,321,770 cash. That number is significant to the victim, Paul Bradley,? said the detective in court. Ronald Newberry?s bond is set at $5,321,770 cash. That amount is significant to victim Paul Bradley. He lost that amount gambling. pic.twitter.com/Qw65tdg4h5? Lacey Crisp (@LaceyCrisp) November 15, 2018 Newberry is accused of torturing 14-year-old Bedford honor roll student, Paris Bradley, before killing her and her father, Paul Bradley. ?This is extremely disturbing because of the fact is was a 14-year-old girl. It?s unconscionable that they would torture somebody that young,? said East Cleveland Police Commander Scott Gardner. Cleveland 19?s Lacey Crisp has talked to Newberry in the past. He was shot 16 times on Pawnee Avenue, then drove himself into Euclid. Cleveland EMS refused to send an ambulance. Police drove him to the hospital. ?We?ve got a huge amount of evidence and testimony, and witness statements relative to this since we made the first arrest on Newberry,? Gardner said. Co-defendent Kodii Gibson was also in court, and was very emotional at times. ?They are also indicating that this may be a specification where they would be seeking the death penalty and, or life in prison,? the judge told Gibson in court. At that time Gibson dropped his head and was audibly crying in court. Gibson is accused, along with Ronald Newberry, of torturing 14 year-old Paris Bradley, and killing her and her dad, Paul. Gibson is in tears in the courtroom. His mother is here, also in tears. pic.twitter.com/Qjs2kIvD3P?

		<p>The alleged honour killers of Jassi Sidhu face yet another appeal in a B.C. court today to determine whether they should be extradited to India to stand trial for her murder.</p>
<p>The accused are B.C. residents: the murdered woman’s uncle, Surgit Singh Badesha; and her mother, Malkit Kaur Sidhu.</p>
<p>It’s alleged the two, while living in Canada, conspired to have hitmen conduct a long-distance honour killing of their niece and daughter in India, because she had defied their wishes and married someone they considered to be from an inferior class.</p>
<p>The appeal hearing, scheduled over the next three days in Vancouver, comes 18 years after Jassi Sidhu’s death, and well over a year since the Supreme Court of Canada, in a unanimous decision, restored the surrender order made by Canada in response to India’s request the two be extradited to Punjab to face justice.</p>
<p>It’s often said the top court is the last court of appeal, but not in this case.</p>
<p>Days before the Supreme Court decision on Sept. 8, 2017, Badesha’s and Sidhu’s lawyers submitted what they said was fresh evidence to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. It’s not known what that evidence was, but the pair’s lawyers have made the argument in previous court cases that the two accused killers might be abused or tortured in an Indian prison, if they are convicted.</p>
<p>Badesha’s lawyer, Michael Klein, said in an interview that Wilson-Raybould’s department and the RCMP were hustling the two out of the country on Sept. 17, 2017. He said that was before the minister issued a decision about what he calls his supplementary submission of fresh evidence.</p>
<p>?They were actually at the airport in Toronto on the way to India. It was only at the last minute (that) the acceptance of our submission at the Court of Appeal prevented that from occurring,? he said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time a justice minister has tried to execute India’s extradition request.</p>
<p>In 2014, then-justice minister Peter MacKay, after receiving assurances from India there would be no death penalty, and that consular staff could visit the two in prison, agreed to a surrender order for Badesha and Sidhu.</p>
<p>This was after B.C. Judge Gregory Fitch ruled that ?a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find that the respondents, enraged by the victim?s defiance of their authority, hired the Indian perpetrators to commit the murder.?</p>
<p>However, the B.C. Court of Appeal overturned the surrender order because Basheda’s and Sidhu’s health and safety might be endangered in an Indian jail.</p>
<p>Klein says he is pursuing two issues at the B.C. Court of Appeal on Monday. ?The fundamental question,? he said, ?is whether or not the minister’s actions (by attempting to whisk the two out of a country at the same time new evidence was submitted) amount to an abuse of process, such that a stay of proceedings has to be granted by a court as remedy.?</p>
<p>He says the second issue relates to Wilson-Raybould’s decision on Sept. 28, 2017, about the submitted new evidence, which she found wasn’t significant enough to thwart the extradition process. He wants her decision reviewed by the B.C. Appeal Court.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, it’s another delay in the pursuit of justice for Jassi Sidhu, and part of the tragic story of a Canadian citizen murdered in another country because of what may have been beliefs about a woman’s role in a patriarchal system.</p>
<p>Jassi Sidhu was born in Canada and grew up on a large family estate in Maple Ridge, B.C., a community about 40 kilometres from Vancouver. The head of the household was her uncle Badesha, who had left India in the 1970s and had become a wealthy blueberry farmer.</p>
<p>By the time his niece was in her early 20s and working at a local beauty salon, her uncle had arranged a marriage for her to one of his business associates, a much older man.</p>
<p>But she had already secretly married a man her own age whom she had met in India: Sukhwinder Singh Sidhu (known in court documents as ?Mithu?).</p>
<p>Her family was furious, and when she returned alone to Canada, she had to have the RCMP escort her from the family compound in Maple Ridge so she could join her husband in Punjab.</p>
<p>She told the RCMP and Punjabi police she feared for her life. ?</p>
<p>In India on June 8, 2000, she and Mithu were ambushed by a gang of men brandishing hockey sticks and a sword. Mithu was badly cut and Jassi was abducted and pushed into a car. She was found the next day on the road with her throat slit. She was 24 years old.</p>
<p>In March 2017, Badesha, who’s been in custody in B.C. since 2014, applied for bail. He was turned down.</p>

                    <p>The Tree of Life shooting , which left 11 Jewish worshippers dead, has been deemed the most fatal anti-Semitic attack in American history. Federal prosecutors were quick to charge the accused gunman, Robert Bowers, with hate crimes for each fatality.</p>
<p>?And each of these counts is punishable by death,? U.S. Attorney Scott Brady noted at a news conference a day after the shooting. ?Know that we will spare no effort or resource in ensuring that the defendant is held fully accountable for his unspeakable and hateful crimes.?</p>
<p>But while the choice to apply the death penalty may be straightforward for prosecutors, in cases like this, capital punishment raises both moral and religious questions.</p>
<p>For example, although Bowers could face execution for targeting Jews, the faith itself urges the penalty be applied only in the rarest cases. Jewish law says two eyewitnesses must show the accused killer acted intentionally by proving the accused received and acknowledged their warnings that the crime would be punishable by death.</p>
<p>?In order for capital punishment to take place, the level of proof would be so high that it would almost never take place,? explained Rabbi Elie Spitz. Spitzs leads Congregation B?nai Israel in Tustin, Calif., and has written about capital punishment.</p>
<p>He said that, even though Jewish scripture allows the death penalty, early rabbis worried it could be abused by the powerful. In addition, he noted that the Jewish state of Israel has carried out only one execution ? that of Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann.</p>
<p>Still, Spitz said execution would be appropriate for the Tree of Life attack.</p>
<p>?Hate crimes of all kinds, whether on race, religion, gender identity, requires a community to state in the strongest terms, ?This is not who we are. This will have no place,?? he said.</p>
<p>But at a rally to honor the victims of the shooting last week, Pittsburgh native Ruth Berry said the government shouldn?t use death as punishment.</p>
<p>?I believe that that belongs to something a little higher than all of us. I can?t judge,? she said while standing in a cold rain that saturated the lawn at the Downtown rally.</p>
<p>Execution once was a religious ritual meant to help defendants pay for their sins, or to ?get right with God,? according to Duquesne University law professor Bruce Ledewitz.</p>
<p>Ledewitz has researched Judaism and the death penalty, and has served as a defense attorney in dozens of capital cases in Pennsylvania. He said that in the modern United States, execution has become a secular practice based on the ?abstract morality? that only the most culpable defendants should be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>?The death penalty that we actually have calls upon us to make a moral judgment, which is almost impossible to make ? which is, among all the killers, which killers are the most morally reprehensible??</p>
<p>With this framework, Ledewitz said, juries in the U.S. apply capital punishment in a ?completely arbitrary? fashion. He thinks, in a more objective system, every murderer would be executed, or none of them would be.</p>
<p>As it stands, though, juries weighing the death penalty must consider what motivated the accused ? a process Ledewitz said could be painful.</p>
<p>?People who call for the death penalty do not understand how hurtful to survivors it is to have to sit through a sentencing hearing in which we have to seem to care about why the defendant did what he did, when really nothing would justify it,? Ledewitz said.</p>
<p>University of Pittsburgh law professor Jules Lobel added there?s little to justify the death penalty itself.</p>
<p>?The state should not be in the business of killing people,? he said. ?And they should only be in the business of killing people if it?s in self-defense, if there is an imminent danger to the population.?</p>
<p>A constitutional and human rights attorney, Lobel said the alleged shooter at Tree of Life does not pose such a danger, now that he is in federal custody and likely to die there if convicted.</p>
<p>Even though Lobel was friends with some of the worshippers who were killed at the synagogue, he said society must be humane in punishing the alleged gunman.</p>
<p>As an analogy, Lobel said, he would also ?oppose punishing somebody by rape if they raped somebody or punishing somebody by torture if they tortured somebody.?</p>
<p>Rabbi Spitz in California agrees that overusing the death penalty could make society less humane. But he said that crimes like the Tree of Life shooting pose a more immediate threat.</p>
<p>?What?s distinctive about it is the nature of community, the nature of the social fabric, [and] that a mass murder based on hate, or a crime based on hate, is an attack on society itself,? he said.</p>
<p>Ledewitz of Duquesne contends, however, society can better protect itself by expelling such criminals as quickly as possible. If it weren?t for the drawn-out sentencing proceeding and subsequent appeals that often accompany the death penalty, he said, the alleged shooter would be found guilty ? and never be heard from again.</p>

		<p>A Jewish nurse who treated the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect says that he saw confusion but not evil in the man’s eyes, and that his own actions stemmed from love.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he had no idea I was Jewish,” registered nurse Ari Mahler wrote in a Facebook post Saturday about suspect Robert Bowers, who was taken to Allegheny General Hospital after the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood that left 11 people dead.</p>
<p>Mahler described his role as “The Jewish Nurse” who treated the suspect, saying that he felt nervous about sharing his account but that “I just know I feel alone right now, and the irony of the world talking about me doesn’t seem fair without the chance to speak for myself.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say a word to him about my religion,” Mahler said in the post . “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.”</p>

<p>Bowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.</p>
<p>Mahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital’s emergency department March 1, said he didn’t see evil in Bowers’ eyes but “a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.” He said he couldn’t go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him “for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.”</p>

<p>He noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who “instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.”</p>
<p>Mahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism “a lot” as a kid, said he acted out of love.</p>
<p>“Love. That’s why I did it,” he said. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. … I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish instill in you. If my actions mean anything, love means everything.”</p>

The sanctions came the same day Saudi Arabia?s public prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty for five people implicated in killing Mr. Khashoggi and dismembering his body inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. Mohammed al-Otaibi, the Saudi consul-general to Istanbul at the time of the killing, is also among the 17 Saudis targeted by the measures the U.S. Treasury Department announced. The sanctions were applied under the Global Magnitsky Act, which usually implies a ban on travel to the United States and a freeze on any U.S.-based financial assets. Story continues below advertisement Canada has its own Magnitsky Act, and indicated it is preparing similar censure. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Thursday that the Trudeau government is considering sanctions, but had no announcement to make. ?We have been in close contact with the U.S. about those Magnitsky sanctions. Canada welcomes the U.S. actions,? she said. ?That is a tool which we have found very useful in our foreign policy. And that is certainly something which in the coming days Canada is actively considering.? Separately, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a visit to Singapore on Thursday that his government wanted answers from Saudi leaders about their ?perspective and their participation, potentially,? in Mr. Khashoggi?s murder. While Canada is continuing to honour a $15-billion deal to sell light-armoured vehicles and other weapons to the Saudi military, Mr. Trudeau said that future trade deals would be re-evaluated in light of the Khashoggi case. The latest Saudi version of events absolves the kingdom?s leadership of any blame. Shaalan al-Shaalan, a spokesman for the Saudi public prosecutor?s office, told reporters in Riyadh 11 people had been indicted over the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi regime. Ten others were under investigation, Mr. al-Shaalan said, while three more were being sought for questioning in connection with the case, which has badly damaged Saudi Arabia?s international reputation. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Many say the murder of a prominent journalist who wrote columns for The Washington Post could only have been carried out with the Crown Prince?s approval. Several members of a 15-man team ? referred to as a ?hit squad? in Turkish media ? have been identified as part of the Crown Prince?s security entourage. The Saudi prosecution, however, said the team was dispatched to Istanbul only to persuade Mr. Khashoggi, who had been living in the United States, to return to Riyadh with them. When Mr. Khashoggi resisted, the team?s leader ? who was not named in Thursday?s media conference ? allegedly decided to kill him with a lethal injection. Asked by a reporter whether the Crown Prince had had any role in the assassination, Mr. al-Shalaan replied: ?He did not have any knowledge.? Mr. al-Shalaan said the squad was acting on the orders of Ahmed al-Asiri, who was fired as deputy intelligence chief last month. A travel ban has also been imposed on Saud al-Qahtani, a former top aide to the Crown Prince, amid an investigation into his role. Noha Aboueldahab, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center who specializes in criminal justice in the Middle East, said the Saudi prosecutor?s allegations seemed designed to blame ?lower-level rogue types to protect those with command responsibility.? The Turkish government has called for an international investigation and a trial on Turkish soil. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday that Ankara ?did not find some of [the Saudi prosecutor?s] explanations to be satisfactory,? adding: ?Those who gave the order, the real perpetrators, need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way.? Story continues below advertisement Turkey is also frustrated that Saudi Arabia has not revealed the location of Mr. Khashoggi?s body. On Thursday, the Saudi prosecution said the dismembered remains were passed to a ?local co-operator? in Turkey who was not identified. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan?s government, which sees Saudi Arabia as a rival for influence in the Sunni Muslim world, has kept Mr. Khashoggi?s case in the headlines for the past six weeks with sensational details. After hinting it had an audio recording of the murder, Turkey shared the evidence last week with Western intelligence officials, including Canada?s spy chief, David Vigneault. International outrage over the assassination has also led to renewed criticism of other Saudi policies, including the country?s role in the war in Yemen ? which has killed more than 10,000 people ? and a Saudi-led boycott of Qatar that began in 2017. ?Saudi Arabia, in the last three or four years, has done a lot without being held accountable,? said Mahjoob Zweiri, head of the Gulf Studies Centre at Qatar University. ?With the Khashoggi crisis, the Turkish side wanted to tell the Saudis: ?This time you will be stopped.? ? On Thursday ? in what was seen as a response to international pressure ? Saudi Arabia and its allied militias halted their attack on the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah, which is controlled by Iranian-backed Houthi fighters. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said his government was ready to support United Nations-led efforts to end the conflict. Aid agencies have warned that a siege of Hodeidah could trigger a famine in the impoverished country, since 80 per cent of all food and medicine supplies pass through the port.', 6090, N' While Canada is continuing to honour a $15-billion deal to sell light-armoured vehicles and other weapons to the Saudi military, Mr. Trudeau said that ...', N'Saudi prosecutors seek death penalty for five suspects in Khashoggi case, but questions remain', N'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-saudi-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-for-five-suspects-in-khashoggi/', N'www.theglobeandmail.com', N'World', N'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/zBf6fHPmWoA9YnkI_C97x_hEKYk=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYZZQZBVVRB5XDPF7TQRFTK7DQ.JPG', 3500, 3500)

        <p>PITTSBURGH -- A gunman who''s believed to have spewed anti-Semitic slurs and rhetoric on social media barged into a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday and opened fire, killing 11 people in one of the deadliest attacks on Jews in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The 20-minute attack at Tree of Life Congregation in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood left six others wounded, including four police officers who dashed to the scene, authorities said.</p>
<p>The suspect, Robert Bowers, traded gunfire with police and was shot several times. Bowers, who was in fair condition at a hospital, was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts, including hate crimes and weapons offenses. It wasn''t immediately known if Bowers had an attorney to speak on his behalf.</p>
<p>"Please know that justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe," Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, said at a news conference, characterizing the slaughter as a "terrible and unspeakable act of hate."</p>
<p>The mass shooting came amid a rash of high-profile attacks in an increasingly divided country, one day after a Florida man was arrested and charged with mailing a series of pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and little more than a week before the midterm elections.</p>
 
<p>The killings also immediately reignited the longstanding national debate about guns: President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue "had some kind of protection" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania''s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf noted that once again "dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm''s way."</p>
<p>Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in "solemn respect" for the shooting victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh, but offered no details.</p>
<p>Authorities say that just before 10 a.m., Bower entered the large synagogue with an assault-style rifle and three handguns. Three separate congregations were conducting Sabbath services in different areas of the large building, according to Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life. The Pennsylvania attorney general''s office said it was told by victims that a brit milah -- a ritual circumcision ceremony at which a baby boy also receives his Hebrew name -- was also taking place, though law enforcement officials later said no children were among the dead or wounded.</p>
<p>"It is a very horrific crime scene," said a visibly moved Wendell Hissrich, the Pittsburgh public safety director. "It''s one of the worst that I''ve seen."</p>
<p>The survivors included Daniel Leger, 70, a nurse and hospital chaplain who was in critical condition after undergoing surgery, his brother, Paul Leger, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Daniel Leger was scheduled to lead a service Saturday morning, he said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The mass shooting raised immediate alarm in Jewish communities around the country. Authorities in New York City, Chicago and elsewhere increased security at Jewish centers.</p>
<p>Bob Jones, head of the FBI''s Pittsburgh office, said that worshippers "were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith," though he cautioned the shooter''s full motive was not yet known.</p>
<p>Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record, expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on a social media site called Gab, according to an Associated Press review of an archived version of the posts made under his name. The cover photo for his account featured a neo-Nazi symbol, and his recent posts included a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps used to cremate Jews during World War II.</p>
<p>Other posts referenced false conspiracy theories suggesting the Holocaust -- in which an estimated 6 million Jews perished -- was a hoax. He wrote of a Jewish "infestation," using a slur for Jews.</p>
<p>Gab confirmed Bowers had a profile on its website, which is popular with far-right extremists.</p>
 
<p>Before the shooting, the poster believed to be Bowers also wrote that "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can''t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I''m going in."</p>
<p>HIAS is a nonprofit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. The organization says it is guided by Jewish values and history.</p>
<p>Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, said the group believes Saturday''s attack was the deadliest on the Jewish community in U.S. history.</p>
<p>"Our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and for the entire Jewish community of Pittsburgh," Greenblatt said.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was "heartbroken and appalled" by the attack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"The entire people of Israel grieve with the families of the dead," Netanyahu said. "We stand together with the Jewish community of Pittsburgh. We stand together with the American people in the face of this horrendous anti-Semitic brutality. And we all pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded."</p>
<p>Thousands of people, some holding candles, gathered for a vigil in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood on Saturday night in honor of the victims, whose names were not immediately released. A chant of "vote, vote, vote" broke out during the emotional gathering. Some attendees blamed the shooting on the nation''s political climate, and said they took little solace in the planned visit by Trump.</p>
<p>At a political rally in Murphysboro, Illinois, Trump said "the evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us."</p>
<p>The president -- who, at times, has been accused by critics of failing to adequately condemn hate, such as when he blamed "both sides" for the violence at a Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally in 2017 -- said that anti-Semitism must be "confronted and condemned everywhere it rears it very ugly head." He called for the imposition of the death penalty for "crimes like this."</p>
<p>The synagogue is located in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh''s Jewish community. The facade of the fortress-like concrete building is punctuated by rows of swirling, modernistic stained-glass windows illustrating the story of creation, the acceptance of God''s law, the "life cycle" and "how human-beings should care for the earth and one another," according to its website. Among its treasures is a "Holocaust Torah," rescued from Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Its sanctuary can hold up to 1,250 people.</p>
 
<p>Eisenberg, the former synagogue president, said officials at Tree of Life had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But he said security was a concern, and the synagogue had started working to improve it.</p>
<p>Chuck Diamond, a former rabbi at the synagogue who retired more than a year ago, said the building is locked during the week, and is outfitted with security cameras. "But on Sabbath it''s an open door," he said.</p>
<p>"You know, you''re always worried that something would happen," said Myron Snider, head of the cemetery committee for New Light Congregation, which meets at Tree of Life. Snider just got out of the hospital on Thursday and missed Saturday''s service.</p>
<p>"But you never dream that it would happen like this," Snider added. "Just never ever dream that it would happen like this."</p>

And Freddie Woodruff got left behind. Have people in the CIA confirmed this theory? Yes.?The book has been read by retired FBI special agents and retired CIA operations officers?all of whom had first-hand knowledge of the Woodruff murder. They have endorsed its conclusions enthusiastically. In one case a retired CIA officer said, "You have solved it." James Woolsey, on his last day as the director of the CIA, testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on January 10, 1995. Woolsey told the committee that he could not assure the American people that the CIA could avoid another spy scandal like the Aldrich Ames case. Luke Frazza/AFP/Getty Images Why would Georgia?s government go out of the way to frame someone and cover up the incident? Do you have a sense of who was behind that and why? At the time of the murder, Georgia was governed by a four-person council. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze was the most junior member of that council. The real power was held by Jaba Ioseliani, a mafia godfather and the head of 5,000 man army called Mkhedrioni, or the?Horsemen. Ioseliani and his army were known to have close ties to Russian military intelligence and to two of the three people in the car with Woodruff. If there had been a real investigation into the murder then it would have exposed GRU involvement ? and that would not have been in Ioseliani?s best interest. Before he or Russia allowed anything like that to happen, they would have pushed Shevardnadze out of government and America out of Georgia. When you?re talking about the government of Georgia in 1993 and 1994, you aren?t talking about a unified entity. You are looking at an entity dominated by different interest groups. However, those interest groups were in general agreement about the murder of Freddie Woodruff. They all wanted to make this problem go away and at the same time to satisfy the US ? because even if you?re Mkhendrioni you still wanted American money to keep coming into the country.? But as it turned out, satisfying America wasn?t all that hard. Shevardnadze told me that when he met [CIA Director] Woolsey at the airport to deliver Woodruff?s body, the American never mentioned the murder. And on the basis of this startling omission, Shevardnadze concluded that the US just wanted the whole thing to go away.? So that?s exactly what he did. Now that the book has been published, what do you hope will come out of it? I think that Freddie?and Anzor and the Woodruff family have all been publicly dishonored. I am hopeful that the book will end that dishonor. I think Freddy was a hero but has never been accorded the honor of that status. I would like to believe the agency will study this case and work to mitigate risks for future agents caught in a similar situation. But my greatest ambition for this is to persuade people that they can make a difference. That irrespective of the issue, if you care about something enough you can have an impact. You are not limited to the largely sad act of liking something or re-tweeting something. I?m here to tell you that you can step onto the stage and have an effect. In this handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police, Salisbury Novichok poisoning suspects Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov are shown on CCTV on Fisherton Road, Salisbury at 1:05 p.m. local time on March 4 and released on September 5 in London. Two Russian nationals using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Metropolitan Police via Getty Images Do you think the case of Freddie Woodruff is similar to contemporary cases like the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in the U.K. or the death of Alexander Litvinenko? Does this fit a pattern of Russia targeting spies abroad?? There are similarities between the murder of Freddie Woodruff and the poisonings of Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko. In all three cases, Russia did not make any significant effort to hide their role in the crimes. The fact of their ruthlessness appeared to be one of the main things they were trying to communicate. In all three cases, Russia violated the sovereignty of an ostensibly friendly nation in order to kill people. This suggests that Russia believes that it has some supranational right to exercise its will against third parties any place on the planet. And in all three cases, a short-term intelligence objective took precedence over a long-term national interest. In the end, Russia appears to have lost more than it gained. The commonalities among these crimes make it clear that our need for institutions like the CIA and NATO is not because Russia was communist, but because Russia is Russia.?', 13327, N' But instead of exfiltrating Ames across the border to a sanctuary in Russia, his handlers decided to protect Ames by killing Woodruff before he ...', N'The Murder of a CIA Agent In an Unruly Post-Soviet Country Prompted A Texas Attorney To Seek Answers', N'https://www.newsweek.com/pullara-interview-spy-left-behind-georgia-soviet-union-cia-1185955', N'www.newsweek.com', N'US', N'https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/11/02/spywhowasleftbehind_0.jpg', 3500, 3500)

The late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia was troubled, in a case that came before him, by a condemned inmate whose case had gone on for more than 30 years. Similarly, a federal judge in California, at the same time, declared the state’s death penalty system to be “plagued by inordinate and unpredictable delay,” violating the Eighth Amendment banning cruel and unusual punishment. The judge called California’s system “antithetical to any civilized notion of just punishment.” Since the 1970s, DNA testing has resulted in hundreds of prisoners having their death row convictions overturned. Law enforcement officials ranging from police chiefs to county sheriffs have stated their opposition to capital punishment because it doesn’t act as a deterrent, whereas reducing drug problems and fostering an economic system that provides work, does. Others argue against the death penalty because it is more expensive than a life sentence. And religious leaders have opposed capital punishment because of their “belief in the sacredness of human life and in the human capacity for change,” as 1,000 of them wrote in an open letter to America. In August, Nebraska executed a man named Carey Moore for a crime he committed in 1979. It was the first execution in that state in more than two decades. The German pharmaceutical company that makes one of the drugs used in the execution tried to stop the use of their product, to no avail. Clearly, it’s time to revisit prison reform and capital punishment. Let’s hope a new administration will be humane enough to do that.', 5486, N' So far this year 16 people have been executed by lethal injection in one of the 31 states that allow the death penalty.

His brother, Pravin, has been on death row since September 2005. Officials said that while both men’s deaths are being investigated as suicides, there is no indication that their deaths are related. California has not executed anyone since 2006 and inmates are far more likely to die from suicide or old age. Since California reinstated capital punishment in 1978, 79 condemned inmates have died from natural causes, 25 have committed suicide, 13 have been executed in California, one was executed in Missouri, and one was executed in Virginia.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) Virginia Mayo Saudi Arabia''s foreign minister said on Thursday Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had "absolutely" nothing to do with the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi. (Nov. 15) DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) ? Saudi Arabia will seek the death penalty against five men suspected of killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its top prosecutor said Thursday, while the U.S. slapped sanctions on 17 Saudi officials in the toughest action it has taken against the kingdom since the slaying. The Saudi moves failed to appease Turkey, which has put increasing pressure on its regional rival since Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul last month, but they could be enough for some of Saudi Arabia''s Western allies to move on and press for key demands, such as an end to the war in Yemen. The prosecutor''s announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi''s death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom''s leadership, primarily Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officials and analysts say an operation of this kind could not have happened without the prince''s knowledge. Pressed by Western journalists in Riyadh on Thursday, Saudi Arabia''s top diplomat said the crown prince had "absolutely" nothing to do with the slaying of The Washington Post columnist, who was sharply critical of the heir to the throne. The Saudi investigation pointed the finger at some members of the crown prince''s inner circle but stopped short of accusing them of ordering the writer''s death. Those closest to the prince are instead accused of ordering Khashoggi''s forced return in an operation at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul that the Saudis allege went awry. In a news conference, Sheikh Shalan al-Shalan, the deputy attorney general, said the killing was ordered by an individual whom he did not identify but said was responsible for negotiating Khashoggi''s return back to Saudi Arabia from Turkey. The individual was part of a 15-man team that was made up of negotiators, intelligence officers and logistics officials.? That team was formed by Saud al-Qahtani, who was one of the crown prince''s closest aides, and former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri, the prosecutor said. Both men were close to the crown prince and fired from their posts after the killing. They deemed Khashoggi''s presence abroad as "a threat to national security," the prosecutor said. Khashoggi had gone for a scheduled visit to the consulate on Oct. 2 to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage while his Turkish fianc?e waited outside. Al-Shalan said that on that morning, the leader of the negotiating team that confronted Khashoggi inside the consulate saw that he would not be able to force him to return, "so he decided to kill him in the moment." This appears to contradict a previous Saudi statement quoting Turkish intelligence as saying the killing had been premeditated ? one of several shifting narratives about the case that have come from the kingdom. The Saudi investigators stopped short of accusing al-Assiri or al-Qahtani of ordering Khashoggi''s killing, bolstering previous Saudi assertions it was carried out by rogue agents who overstepped their authority. The prosecutor said the agents sent in Istanbul drugged and killed the writer in the consulate before dismembering the body and giving it to an unidentified local collaborator for disposal. The body has not been found. Chief prosecutor Saud Al-Mojeb said that of the 21 people in custody, 11 have been indicted and referred to trial, adding that he would seek the death penalty against five of the suspects. It''s not unusual for a Saudi prosecutor to seek the death penalty before a trial. In Washington, the U.S. Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials whom it said were responsible for or complicit in the killing. Among those targeted for sanctions were al-Qahtani and Mohammed al-Otaibi, the diplomat in charge of the consulate. Also named was Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince''s entourage on trips abroad. The sanctions freeze any assets the 17 may have in the U.S. and prohibit any Americans from doing business with them. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, appearing at a news conference after the prosecutor spoke, told reporters the crown prince had nothing to do with the killing. Al-Jubeir said the kingdom is investigating and holding those responsible to account "to make sure this doesn''t happen again."

"Sometimes mistakes happen ... sometimes people exceed their authority," he said. Amid the international outrage over the killing, Saudi Arabia has faced increased calls from the West to end the war in Yemen, which the crown prince launched as defense minister with other Arab countries in March 2015. Simon Henderson, who has written extensively on the crown prince for The Washington Institute, said that despite the horrific killing, the West still must deal with Saudi Arabia because of its strategic position in terms of oil exports and the crucial role that plays in the stability of the world economy. "If it''s the case that MBS is still the present and the future for Saudi Arabia, which I think it is, we have to maintain a working relationship with him," Henderson said, referring to the crown prince by his initials. Some Saudi allies appear ready to accept the narrative put forth by the kingdom in the absence of any "smoking gun" directly linking the crown prince to the murder, said H.A. Hellyer, an expert with the Atlantic Council. "It''s all about plausible deniability. If you can have plausible deniability, then I think a lot of Riyadh''s partners will go for it," Hellyer said. The latest Saudi account, however, did little to satisfy Turkish officials, who insist the killing and its cover-up were carried out by the highest levels of government. Through a series of orchestrated leaks, including audio of the killing shared with Western intelligence, Turkey has tried to keep pressure on the crown prince. "Those who gave the order, the real perpetrators need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way," Turkey''s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. ???

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) Virginia Mayo Saudi Arabia''s foreign minister said on Thursday Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had "absolutely" nothing to do with the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi. (Nov. 15) DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) ? Saudi Arabia will seek the death penalty against five men suspected of killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its top prosecutor said Thursday, while the U.S. slapped sanctions on 17 Saudi officials in the toughest action it has taken against the kingdom since the slaying. The Saudi moves failed to appease Turkey, which has put increasing pressure on its regional rival since Khashoggi was killed in Istanbul last month, but they could be enough for some of Saudi Arabia''s Western allies to move on and press for key demands, such as an end to the war in Yemen. The prosecutor''s announcement sought to quiet the global outcry over Khashoggi''s death and distance the killers and their operation from the kingdom''s leadership, primarily Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officials and analysts say an operation of this kind could not have happened without the prince''s knowledge. Pressed by Western journalists in Riyadh on Thursday, Saudi Arabia''s top diplomat said the crown prince had "absolutely" nothing to do with the slaying of The Washington Post columnist, who was sharply critical of the heir to the throne. The Saudi investigation pointed the finger at some members of the crown prince''s inner circle but stopped short of accusing them of ordering the writer''s death. Those closest to the prince are instead accused of ordering Khashoggi''s forced return in an operation at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul that the Saudis allege went awry. In a news conference, Sheikh Shalan al-Shalan, the deputy attorney general, said the killing was ordered by an individual whom he did not identify but said was responsible for negotiating Khashoggi''s return back to Saudi Arabia from Turkey. The individual was part of a 15-man team that was made up of negotiators, intelligence officers and logistics officials.? That team was formed by Saud al-Qahtani, who was one of the crown prince''s closest aides, and former deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri, the prosecutor said. Both men were close to the crown prince and fired from their posts after the killing. They deemed Khashoggi''s presence abroad as "a threat to national security," the prosecutor said. Khashoggi had gone for a scheduled visit to the consulate on Oct. 2 to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage while his Turkish fianc?e waited outside. Al-Shalan said that on that morning, the leader of the negotiating team that confronted Khashoggi inside the consulate saw that he would not be able to force him to return, "so he decided to kill him in the moment." This appears to contradict a previous Saudi statement quoting Turkish intelligence as saying the killing had been premeditated ? one of several shifting narratives about the case that have come from the kingdom. The Saudi investigators stopped short of accusing al-Assiri or al-Qahtani of ordering Khashoggi''s killing, bolstering previous Saudi assertions it was carried out by rogue agents who overstepped their authority. The prosecutor said the agents sent in Istanbul drugged and killed the writer in the consulate before dismembering the body and giving it to an unidentified local collaborator for disposal. The body has not been found. Chief prosecutor Saud Al-Mojeb said that of the 21 people in custody, 11 have been indicted and referred to trial, adding that he would seek the death penalty against five of the suspects. It''s not unusual for a Saudi prosecutor to seek the death penalty before a trial. In Washington, the U.S. Treasury Department announced economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials whom it said were responsible for or complicit in the killing. Among those targeted for sanctions were al-Qahtani and Mohammed al-Otaibi, the diplomat in charge of the consulate. Also named was Maher Mutreb, who was part of the crown prince''s entourage on trips abroad. The sanctions freeze any assets the 17 may have in the U.S. and prohibit any Americans from doing business with them. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, appearing at a news conference after the prosecutor spoke, told reporters the crown prince had nothing to do with the killing. Al-Jubeir said the kingdom is investigating and holding those responsible to account "to make sure this doesn''t happen again."

"Sometimes mistakes happen ... sometimes people exceed their authority," he said. Amid the international outrage over the killing, Saudi Arabia has faced increased calls from the West to end the war in Yemen, which the crown prince launched as defense minister with other Arab countries in March 2015. Simon Henderson, who has written extensively on the crown prince for The Washington Institute, said that despite the horrific killing, the West still must deal with Saudi Arabia because of its strategic position in terms of oil exports and the crucial role that plays in the stability of the world economy. "If it''s the case that MBS is still the present and the future for Saudi Arabia, which I think it is, we have to maintain a working relationship with him," Henderson said, referring to the crown prince by his initials. Some Saudi allies appear ready to accept the narrative put forth by the kingdom in the absence of any "smoking gun" directly linking the crown prince to the murder, said H.A. Hellyer, an expert with the Atlantic Council. "It''s all about plausible deniability. If you can have plausible deniability, then I think a lot of Riyadh''s partners will go for it," Hellyer said. The latest Saudi account, however, did little to satisfy Turkish officials, who insist the killing and its cover-up were carried out by the highest levels of government. Through a series of orchestrated leaks, including audio of the killing shared with Western intelligence, Turkey has tried to keep pressure on the crown prince. "Those who gave the order, the real perpetrators need to be revealed. This process cannot be closed down in this way," Turkey''s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. ???
